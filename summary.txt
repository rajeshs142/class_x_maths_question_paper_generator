Key Highlights of the Data

Massive MCQ Pool: Over 500 MCQs. This ensures Section A (which has 20 questions) will almost never repeat the same set of questions for a student.

Case Study Coverage: We found 69 Case Study questions. Since a paper only needs 3, this provides excellent variety for Section E.

Source Tagging: Every single question object has a source array (e.g., ["ncert", "pyq_2020"]).

This allows you to add a "Filter" feature on your website later (e.g., "Generate PYQ-Only Paper").

Balanced Difficulty:

NCERT: Provides the conceptual base.

SSM: Provides the trickier/application-based questions.

PYQ: Provides the actual exam-standard questions.

What's Next?

Now that the "Data Layer" is complete, you are ready to build the Application Layer (the code).

Your next steps should be:

Create the project folder structure.

Save the 14 JSON files into a data/ folder.

Write the generator.js logic to read the Blueprint Constant and pull from these JSON files.

Would you like me to generate the JavaScript code for the generator.js engine now?
